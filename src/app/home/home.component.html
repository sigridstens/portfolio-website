      Fax-whisperer by day,
      aspiring designer by night.
    </h1>
    <p>I am a self-driven student of graphic and web design, with a fascination in user experience and a day job at a Minneapolis non-profit.
      <br><br>
      Formally educated in Anthropology, I have spent my professional years collecting experiences in content marketing, interpretive exhibit planning, project management, and graphic design.
      My interdisciplinary background has shaped my approach to designâ€“focusing my work on creating experiences and designs that are enjoyable and improve the lives of the people who interact with them.
